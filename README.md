# <img src="wave.gif" width="28px" height="28px"> Hi there! I'm Victor.

I am a goal oriented developer interested in blockchain, the web and long distance triathlon.

## 🛠 Tech I Use

Nowadays, I write **TypeScript** code in **SvelteKit** applications that I style with **TailwindCSS**. I write smart contracts in **Solidity** using the **Hardhat** blockchain development framework. My editor of choice is **VS Code** and I use **Excalidraw** to create designs with a hand written feel. Whenever I can, I host my apps on **Vercel**. I use **Notion** to manage my side-projects and most of my life.

Also, I **git** everything.

## 👨‍💻 Side Projects

Take a look at my pinned repos!

## 🚴‍♂️ Hobby

Besides coding, I swim, bike & run.

Currently training for my first **IRONMAN** in Mont-Tremblant, August 2022.
